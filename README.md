# Alignment Research Engine Accelerator (ARENA) 3.0 Course with a focus on Mechanistic Interpretability

## Overview

This repository contains my work and notes for **Chapters 0 and 1** of the ARENA (Alignment Research Engineer Accelerator) course. I am going to focus on developing skills in **mechanistic interpretability**, with an emphasis on transformer models and Sparse AutoEncoders. 

## Objectives

1. **Chapter 0: Fundamentals**
   - Gain proficiency in the tools and frameworks used in the course.
   - Strengthen foundational knowledge of neural networks and optimization techniques.
   - Set up a robust environment for experimenting with models.

2. **Chapter 1: Transformers & Mechanistic Interpretability**
   - Understand the architecture of transformers, including attention mechanisms and embeddings.
   - Explore the internal mechanisms of transformers using tools like `TransformerLens`.
   - Conduct experiments to reverse-engineer model behaviors and interpret attention heads and circuits.
